simpleweather is an R package that simply retrieves weather data for a vector of dates:

```{r example}
library(simpleweather)
dates <- seq(Sys.Date() - 10, Sys.Date() + 5, by = 'day')
weather <- get_weather(dates)
tail(weather, 10)
```

Currently only works for Central Park, NY. Location argument coming soon.
